# Install Armitage on Linux
This is a program that will install Metasploit-Framework and Armitage on to any Debian-based Linux Distro (it can also be adapted to work on Mac).
This was made possible using a combination of my own code, darkoperator's, and a nightly Metasploit installer from rapid7.

## Usage
To run this program and begin installation:
```bash
$ chmod +x ArmitageInstaller
$ sudo bash ArmitageInstaller
```

## Using Metasploit and Armitage
*After the script runs successfully*

Launch Metasploit using:

```bash
$ sudo msfconsole
```

Launch Armitage using:
```bash
$ sudo armitage
```
